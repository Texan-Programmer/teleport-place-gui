go to assest manager in the view section

then press places, then create a place and copy the id of it (this will be important later)

create a screengui and call that what you want then make a frame and call it ButtonFrame after create a image or text button and name that TeleportButton

after create a script in the starter gui (local script if you only want it to teleport the player touching the button)
